Summarize content from multiple sources using LLM's  
  
This work is meant to help understand how an LLM can be used to distil security content from multiple sources into a single summary. As part of this, exploration of various offline LLM and image generation models was performed. It does so by reading content from multiple input url's, summarizing them together, and generating an article with a title and image.

Model Cards:

- [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)

Note: To avoid plagiarism, articles from Wikipedia were used instead of actual intelligence articles.
